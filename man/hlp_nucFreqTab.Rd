\title{Calculate nucleotide frequency pileup for all gene models}
\usage{
hlp_nucFreqTab(x, simplify_IUPAC = "not")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{CompressedGRangesList. Genomic Ranges list containing genomic
alignments data by gene. Constructed via tx_reads().}

\item{simplify_IUPAC}{character. Method to simplify ambiguous reads:
1) 'not': Ambiguous reads will be left as their IUPAC_ambiguous code, e.g.
for positions in which a 'G' and and 'A' where read an 'R' will note this.
2) "splitHalf': Ambiguous reads will be divided in half, in odd cases having
fractions of reads assigned.
3) "splitForceInt": Ambiguous reads will be divided in half, but forced to be
integers, unassigned fraction of reads will be summed and assigned as 'N'.}
