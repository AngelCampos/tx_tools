\arguments{
\item{DT}{data.table. Output of txtools data.tables with coverage information
as output of \code{\link{tx_coverageDT}} \code{\link{tx_covNucFreqDT}}
functions.}

\item{annotCol}{character. Name of column from which to retrieve centers,
should be a logical annotation.}

\item{valuesCol}{character. Name of column from which to get values}

\item{flankSize}{numeric. The size of flanks for both left and right side.}

\item{minCov}{numeric. Minimum coverage required at center of position to
output results. Not filtered by default.}

\item{nCores}{integer. Number of cores to use to run function. Multi-core
capability not available in Windows OS.}

\description{
Get the data from positions marked with TRUE in a logical variable as the
center and the values in its vicinity, delimited by a flank size.
Useful to aggregate data surrounding specific sites as motif locations.
