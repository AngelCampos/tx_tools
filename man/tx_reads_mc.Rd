  reads,

  nCores,
  overlapType = "within",
  minReads = 50,
  withSeq = F,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{reads}{GAlignmentPairs. Paired end genomic alignments to be processed}

\item{geneAnnot}{GenomicRanges. Gene annotation loaded via the tx_load_bed()}

\item{nCores}{integer. Number of cores to use to run function.}

\item{overlapType}{character. Overlap type to filter reads by gene model.}

\item{minReads}{integer. Minimum number of reads required to overlap a gene
model to be part of the output object.}

\item{withSeq}{logical. Set to TRUE if sequence should be preserved; 'reads'
object should contain sequences.}

\item{verbose}{logical. Set to FALSE to show less information.}
